The Chauvet Professional REM 1 comes in 2 flavors-1000x500mm and thhe 500x500mm. The smaller of the 2 is referred to as the "SQ", or "square" panel. The SQ requires a different version of the software, or NCP file.

## Control Software

Please review the serial number prefix ("A", "B", ect) of your panels. Then, navigate to the appropriate folder for your LED batch. Selecting the incorrect LED batch will casue the color calibration to show incorrectly.
